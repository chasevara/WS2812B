# WS2812B
A driver for WS2812B "Neopixel" LED arrays developed for STM32F4, optimized with circular DMA to mininize CPU usage and RAM footprint needed for data transfer to large LED arrays.

WS2812_16x16matrix_2x2array builds on this to drive a 32x32 RGB LED matrix composed of four (16x16) WS2812B panels.
